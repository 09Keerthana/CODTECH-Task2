Overview of the Project

Project: Student Grade Tracker


Objective:
The primary objective of the Student Grade Tracker project is to develop a simple console-based application that allows users (teachers or students) to input student names, the number of subjects, and corresponding marks. The application calculates the average grade, assigns a letter grade, and provides feedback on performance. This project aims to enhance programming skills while creating a functional tool for academic performance tracking.

Key Activities:

User Input Handling:
The program prompts the user to enter the student's name and the number of subjects.
It then collects the marks for each subject, calculating the total.

Grade Calculation:
The program calculates the average grade by dividing the total marks by the number of subjects.

Grade Assignment:
A method (getLetterGrade) assigns a letter grade based on the average score:

Performance Feedback:
Another method (getPerformanceMessage) provides a personalized performance message based on the assigned letter grade.

Loop for Multiple Entries:
The program includes a loop that allows users to enter details for multiple students until they choose to exit.

Output Display:
The average grade, letter grade, and performance message are displayed for each student.


Technologies Used:

Programming Language: Java
Development Tools:Visual Studio Code for coding.
